# Query Kubernetes API Server Address

1. Open a new Terminal window.

2. Run the following command to get the API server address:

```bash
kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}'
```

3. The command will return the Kubernetes API server address, for example:

```bash
https://127.0.0.1:6443
```

You can use this address for configurations that require the Kubernetes API server address, such as setting up Vault or other third-party services.


# Ngrok Installation and Configuration Guide for Mac

## Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

1. Open a new Terminal window.

2. Run the following command to install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Install Ngrok

1. After installing Homebrew, install ngrok by running:

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

## Run Ngrok

1. To run ngrok against a specific port (e.g., 6443), open a new Terminal window and type:

```bash
ngrok http 6443
```

2. This will give you a public URL that forwards to your local server. Look for a line like:

```text
Forwarding https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:6443
```

3. Note down the public URL (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io`); you'll use this for configurations.
